START_SCREEN_LETNEV:0 "The Dark Years are over.\n\nIt has been centuries since the Twilight Wars brought about the fall of the old Lazax Imperium and threw the galaxy into chaos, leading to a total collapse of civilization.\n\nThe Letnev were always an ambitious and proud people. Our discipline and military culture brings only the strongest and smartest into positions of power. Our legendary troops are only surpassed in brute strength by the Tekklar N'orr legions of distant Quinarra. Throughout the time of the Lazax, the Letnev led two unsuccessful rebellions against the Imperium. This history of dissention served as justification for a constant imperial oversight and strict food and import controls.\n\nBut our ambition could not be contained. It was the Letnev blockade of the Quann wormhole that ignited the Twilight Wars and the final downfall of the empire.\n\nThis history is all but forgotten. There are only a few who remember and who now, with the recent re-discovery of spaceflight and the hyperlane network, work to push the Letnev civilization to final dominance of the galaxy. Chief among them is the Baron himself, who has only one ambition. To become emperor at any cost." ##polish and make the reference
