###### I want to change this ######
# a perfect representation would apply movement bonusses to the big ships and offense bonus to the small ships #
# WHILE THEY ARE ACTIVE IN THE SAME FLEET #
# currently this is funny but borderline useless #
# easier to implement: get all the bonusses for all ships
# but attach them to the ship techs
# that way players don't have to build weird fleets (gravleash is weird even in TI4 as a breakthrough)
